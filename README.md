# Anti-Parallelism-
tool checking 4 voice realization for piano for the music harmony

works from the terminal by command : python GRADER.py "path\to\your\harmony\assignment\filename.xml"

all files to check shoud be notated for piano in 4 voices (2 in left hand, 2 in the right one)

the project is unfinished, it has bugs in real parallelism vs repeated interval with the same notes recognition algorithms
